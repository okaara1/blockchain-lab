# Hyperledger Fabric Intro Lab!
This is a very simple demonstration of how to write smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric (1.4). During this lab, you will:


1. Create and package your first smart contract
2. Connect to a local instance of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain
3. Run and debug a smart contract
4. Submit transactions to the ledger


We will be doing the development using a Fabric extension to VS Code. There are other ways to develop Fabric blockchain contracts, but using the extension is a good way to start the first time. And, if you ever want to migrate your code to IBM Blockchain Platform in IBM Cloud, it will be a lot easier.


## Prerequisites (preferrably latest)
- VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
